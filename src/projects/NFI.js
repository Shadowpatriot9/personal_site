                            NFI was a project that I started in October of 2020. The goal of the project was to design and
                            create a rocket propulsion system aimed to achieve a more efficient way of travel for a 2nd-stage rocket launch vehicle
                            to acomplish a long distance journey in an optimial time (e.g. journey to Jupiter). The project itself went no more past the
                            conceptual phase in design as the main limitation to the project was a lack of education/knowledge in developing
                            this system indepently as intended. However, I'm showcasing this incomplete archived project here because
                            during my exploration in developing this system allowed for a lot of self reflection and reignited my
                            interest in engineering to which led to my personal transition of moving to a different location and pursue higher
                            education further in an engineering discipline with the application of aerospace.

                            <h3> Background: </h3>
                            The design of the system had a few core and sub systems apart from the generic main compents of a traditional/basic propulsion system.
                            As I debated and went several iterations of what the influence or main direction to the design would become, the main influence
                            of the concept revolved around the idea of reigniting an old idea and apply it with modern capabilities.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            More specifically, it revolved around this idea called the "Bussard Ramjet" (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bussard_ramjet">Link</a>)
                            that was introduced in 1960 by a pyhsicist named Robert Bussard. The idea was to (in theory) collect hydrogen gas in space during travel and
                            use it as a fuel source for a rocket propulsion system simtaneously in transit
                            by deploying a large magnetic field to collect the gas as the launch vehicle continued. The idea was never implemented due to the lack of
                            technology as well as our limited data of space in general, but the idea was continiously revisted
                            over the years with each revisition having a complication of implementation
                            primarily due to the lack of technology.
