### How to Test
1. Start the development server: `npm start`
2. Go to `http://localhost:3000/admin`
3. Use the development credentials above
4. You should see the admin dashboard with project management

## Production Deployment

For production deployment on Vercel:

1. **Generate production credentials**:
   ```bash
   node setup-admin.js
   ```

2. **Set environment variables** in Vercel dashboard:
   - `ADMIN_USERNAME=shadowpatriot9`
   - `ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH=[generated hash]`
   - `JWT_SECRET=[generated secret]`
   - `MONGO_URI=[your MongoDB connection string]`

3. **Deploy** to Vercel

## Features Fixed

- ✅ Login form validation
- ✅ Session persistence
- ✅ Logout functionality
- ✅ Project management (development mode)
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ Network fallback

## File Changes Made

- `src/Admin.js` - Enhanced authentication logic
- `api/admin/login.js` - Fixed API with fallback authentication
- `vercel.json` - Added Vercel configuration
- `test-admin.js` - Created testing script

## Next Steps

The admin login is now working! You can:
1. Test locally with the development credentials
2. Add/edit/delete projects (in dev mode, changes are local only)
3. Deploy to production with proper environment variables for persistent storage

The system will automatically detect if it's running in development or production and behave accordingly.
