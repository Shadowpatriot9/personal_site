I was intrigued by the size of the station that I started to think about how it would be built and more importantly, how \n          it could be built practically.\n          <br />\n          <br />\n          After much thought, I came to an idea that we (as a species) needed a better way to obtain materials which led to an idea of creating a duplicator machine (yes, like in Star Trek lol).\n          After briefly drafting it, I quickly noticed the scope of the project and narrowed it down to the concept of simply concerting a base element into another.\n          Water was chosen as the ideal input primarily due to two reasons. 1. It's the most abundant resource on the planet and 2. It's a simple molecule to break down.\n          Then once the idea was finalized, it was off to the races of concepts and designs. 😀\n        </section>\n        {/* Section | Concept */}\n        <section className=\"section\" id=\"concept\">\n          <h3> Concept: </h3>\n          Core: \n          <li></li>\n          Sub: \n          <li></li>\n        </section>  \n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </main>\n  {/* Footer */}\n  <footer> \n    {/* Copyright */}\n    <div className=\"graphic\">\n          <p> © 2025 Grayden Scovil </p> \n          </div>\n          {/* Love Note */}\n          <div className=\"love-note\">\n            <p> \n              Made with \n              <svg version=\"{1.0}\" id=\"Layer_1\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" xmlnsxlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" width=\"23px\" height=\"13px\" viewBox=\"0 0 64 64\" enablebackground=\"new 0 0 64 64\" xmlspace=\"preserve\" fill=\"#ffffff\"><g id=\"SVGRepo_bgCarrier\" strokewidth=\"{0}\" /><g id=\"SVGRepo_tracerCarrier\" strokelinecap=\"round\" strokelinejoin=\"round\" /><g id=\"SVGRepo_iconCarrier\"> <path fill=\"#ffffff\" d=\"M47.977,5.99c-4.416,0-8.414,1.792-11.308,4.686l-4.685,4.654l-4.686-4.654 C24.406,7.782,20.408,5.99,15.992,5.99C7.161,5.99,0,13.15,0,21.982c0,4.416,2.85,8.539,5.747,11.432l23.41,23.414 c1.562,1.562,4.092,1.562,5.653,0l23.349-23.352c2.896-2.893,5.81-7.078,5.81-11.494C63.969,13.15,56.808,5.99,47.977,5.99z\" /> </g></svg>\n            </p>\n          </div>  \n  </footer>\n</div>\n\n  );\n}\n\nexport default Naton;"],"mappings":"AAAA,MAAO,CAAAA,KAAK,KAAM,OAAO,CACzB,OAASC,IAAI,KAAQ,kBAAkB,CAEvC,MAAO,4BAA4B,CACnC,MAAO,CAAAC,OAAO,KAAM,4BAA4B,CAAC,OAAAC,GAAA,IAAAC,IAAA,CAAAC,IAAA,IAAAC,KAAA,yBAEjD,QAAS,CAAAC,KAAKA,CAAA,CAAI,CAChB,mBACFD,KAAA,QAAKE,SAAS,CAAEN,OAAO,CAACO,KAAM,CAACC,EAAE,CAAC,OAAO,CAAAC,QAAA,eAGvCP,IAAA,SAAMQ,OAAO,CAAC,OAAO,CAACC,IAAI,CAAC,UAAU,CAACC,OAAO,CAAC,uCAAuC,CAAE,CAAC,cAExFV,IAAA,UAAAO,QAAA,CAAO,SAAO,CAAO,CAAC,cAEtBP,IAAA,SAAMW,GAAG,CAAC,YAAY,CAACC,IAAI,CAAC,YAAY,CAAE,CAAC,cAG3CZ,IAAA,QAAKI,SAAS,CAAC,SAAS,CAACE,EAAE,CAAC,SAAS,CAAE,CAAC,cAGxCN,IAAA,WAAQM,EAAE,CAAC,QAAQ,CAAAC,QAAA,cACnBP,IAAA,CAACH,IAAI,EAACgB,EAAE,CAAC,GAAG,CAAAN,QAAA,cACVP,IAAA,WAAQM,EAAE,CAAC,QAAQ,CAAAC,QAAA,CAAC,IAAE,CAAQ,CAAC,CAC3B,CAAC,CACC,CAAC,cAETP,IAAA,SAAAO,QAAA,cACEL,KAAA,QAAKE,SAAS,CAAC,WAAW,CAAAG,QAAA,eAExBL,KAAA,QAAKE,SAAS,CAAC,QAAQ,CAAAG,QAAA,eAErBP,IAAA,YAASM,EAAE,CAAC,OAAO,CAAAC,QAAA,cACjBP,IAAA,OAAAO,QAAA,CAAI,SAAO,CAAI,CAAC,CACT,CAAC,cAEVL,KAAA,YAASE,SAAS,CAAC,SAAS,CAACE,EAAE,CAAC,OAAO,CAAAC,QAAA,eACrCL,KAAA,OAAAK,QAAA,EAAI,gBAAc,cAAAP,IAAA,MAAAO,QAAA,CAAG,6BAA2B,CAAG,CAAC,IAAC,EAAI,CAAC,cAC1DL,KAAA,OAAAK,QAAA,eACEP,IAAA,QAAKc,IAAI,CAAC,SAAS,CAACC,KAAK,CAAC,MAAM,CAACC,MAAM,CAAC,MAAM,CAACC,OAAO,CAAC,KAAK,CAACX,EAAE,CAAC,QAAQ,CAACY,KAAK,CAAC,4BAA4B,CAACC,UAAU,CAAC,8BAA8B,CAACC,OAAO,CAAC,mBAAmB,CAACC,QAAQ,CAAC,UAAU,CAAAd,QAAA,cACjML,KAAA,MAAAK,QAAA,EAAG,GAAC,cAAAP,IAAA,SAAMsB,CAAC,CAAC,2hBAA2hB,CAAE,CAAC,IAAC,EAAG,CAAC,CAC9iB,CAAC,qDAEN,cAAAtB,IAAA,QAAKc,IAAI,CAAC,SAAS,CAACC,KAAK,CAAC,MAAM,CAACC,MAAM,CAAC,MAAM,CAACC,OAAO,CAAC,KAAK,CAACX,EAAE,CAAC,QAAQ,CAACY,KAAK,CAAC,4BAA4B,CAACC,UAAU,CAAC,8BAA8B,CAACC,OAAO,CAAC,mBAAmB,CAACC,QAAQ,CAAC,UAAU,CAAAd,QAAA,cACjML,KAAA,MAAAK,QAAA,EAAG,GAAC,cAAAP,IAAA,SAAMsB,CAAC,CAAC,2hBAA2hB,CAAE,CAAC,IAAC,EAAG,CAAC,CAC9iB,CAAC,EACJ,CAAC,wsBAQL,cAAAtB,IAAA,QAAK,CAAC,cACNA,IAAA,QAAK,CAAC,i7BASR,EAAS,CAAC,EACP,CAAC,cAENE,KAAA,QAAKE,SAAS,CAAC,QAAQ,CAAAG,QAAA,eAErBL,KAAA,YAASE,SAAS,CAAC,SAAS,CAACE,EAAE,CAAC,YAAY,CAAAC,QAAA,eAC1CP,IAAA,OAAAO,QAAA,CAAI,eAAa,CAAI,CAAC,4vBAOtB,cAAAP,IAAA,QAAK,CAAC,cACNA,IAAA,QAAK,CAAC,ulBAKR,EAAS,CAAC,cAEVE,KAAA,YAASE,SAAS,CAAC,SAAS,CAACE,EAAE,CAAC,SAAS,CAAAC,QAAA,eACvCP,IAAA,OAAAO,QAAA,CAAI,YAAU,CAAI,CAAC,QAEnB,cAAAP,IAAA,QAAQ,CAAC,OAET,cAAAA,IAAA,QAAQ,CAAC,EACF,CAAC,EACP,CAAC,EACH,CAAC,CACF,CAAC,cAEPE,KAAA,WAAAK,QAAA,eAEEP,IAAA,QAAKI,SAAS,CAAC,SAAS,CAAAG,QAAA,cAClBP,IAAA,MAAAO,QAAA,CAAG,4BAAuB,CAAG,CAAC,CACzB,CAAC,cAENP,IAAA,QAAKI,SAAS,CAAC,WAAW,CAAAG,QAAA,cACxBL,KAAA,MAAAK,QAAA,EAAG,WAED,cAAAL,KAAA,QAAKe,OAAO,CAAC,OAAO,CAACX,EAAE,CAAC,SAAS,CAACY,KAAK,CAAC,4BAA4B,CAACK,UAAU,CAAC,8BAA8B,CAACR,KAAK,CAAC,MAAM,CAACC,MAAM,CAAC,MAAM,CAACI,OAAO,CAAC,WAAW,CAACI,gBAAgB,CAAC,eAAe,CAACC,QAAQ,CAAC,UAAU,CAACX,IAAI,CAAC,SAAS,CAAAP,QAAA,eAACP,IAAA,MAAGM,EAAE,CAAC,mBAAmB,CAACoB,WAAW,CAAC,KAAK,CAAE,CAAC,cAAA1B,IAAA,MAAGM,EAAE,CAAC,uBAAuB,CAACqB,aAAa,CAAC,OAAO,CAACC,cAAc,CAAC,OAAO,CAAE,CAAC,cAAA1B,KAAA,MAAGI,EAAE,CAAC,qBAAqB,CAAAC,QAAA,EAAC,GAAC,cAAAP,IAAA,SAAMc,IAAI,CAAC,SAAS,CAACQ,CAAC,CAAC,iTAAiT,CAAE,CAAC,IAAC,EAAG,CAAC,EAAK,CAAC,EAC/sB,CAAC,CACD,CAAC,EACN,CAAC,EACN,CAAC,CAGN,CAEA,cAAe,CAAAnB,KAAK","ignoreList":[]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}
