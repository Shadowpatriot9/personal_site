This was started in 2017 and in the\n              world of tech at that time, we were starting to see breakthroughs in VR technology with the Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive. As students,\n              there were a lot of typical problems that other groups in the class were focusing on (parking....my god, 4 out of the like 10 teams or so \n              did something about parking lol) and so we wanted to do something that was more geared towards a different area where no one was looking \n              and the only we had to do was to see that our other classmates were more engaged than others when starting the assignment. Then we were off.\n            </section>  \n            <section className=\"section\" id=\"concept\">\n              <h3> Concept: </h3>\n              Core: \n              <li> </li>\n              Sub: \n              <li> </li>\n            </section>  \n          </div> \n        </div>\n      </main>\n      {/* Footer */}\n      <footer> \n        {/* Copyright */}\n        <div className=\"graphic\">\n          <p> © 2025 Grayden Scovil </p> \n          </div>\n          {/* Love Note */}\n          <div className=\"love-note\">\n            <p> \n              Made with \n              <svg version=\"{1.0}\" id=\"Layer_1\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" xmlnsxlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" width=\"23px\" height=\"13px\" viewBox=\"0 0 64 64\" enablebackground=\"new 0 0 64 64\" xmlspace=\"preserve\" fill=\"#ffffff\"><g id=\"SVGRepo_bgCarrier\" strokewidth=\"{0}\" /><g id=\"SVGRepo_tracerCarrier\" strokelinecap=\"round\" strokelinejoin=\"round\" /><g id=\"SVGRepo_iconCarrier\"> <path fill=\"#ffffff\" d=\"M47.977,5.99c-4.416,0-8.414,1.792-11.308,4.686l-4.685,4.654l-4.686-4.654 C24.406,7.782,20.408,5.99,15.992,5.99C7.161,5.99,0,13.15,0,21.982c0,4.416,2.85,8.539,5.747,11.432l23.41,23.414 c1.562,1.562,4.092,1.562,5.653,0l23.349-23.352c2.896-2.893,5.81-7.078,5.81-11.494C63.969,13.15,56.808,5.99,47.977,5.99z\" /> </g></svg>\n            </p>\n          </div>  \n      </footer>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default EL;\n"],"mappings":"AAAA,MAAO,CAAAA,KAAK,KAAM,OAAO,CACzB,OAASC,IAAI,KAAQ,kBAAkB,CAEvC,MAAO,4BAA4B,CACnC,MAAO,CAAAC,OAAO,KAAM,4BAA4B,CAAC,OAAAC,GAAA,IAAAC,IAAA,CAAAC,IAAA,IAAAC,KAAA,yBAEjD,QAAS,CAAAC,EAAEA,CAAA,CAAG,CACZ,mBACFD,KAAA,QAAKE,SAAS,CAAEN,OAAO,CAACO,KAAM,CAACC,EAAE,CAAC,OAAO,CAAAC,QAAA,eAGnCP,IAAA,SAAMQ,OAAO,CAAC,OAAO,CAACC,IAAI,CAAC,UAAU,CAACC,OAAO,CAAC,uCAAuC,CAAE,CAAC,cAExFV,IAAA,UAAAO,QAAA,CAAO,MAAI,CAAO,CAAC,cAEnBP,IAAA,SAAMW,GAAG,CAAC,YAAY,CAACC,IAAI,CAAC,YAAY,CAAE,CAAC,cAG3CZ,IAAA,QAAKI,SAAS,CAAC,SAAS,CAACE,EAAE,CAAC,SAAS,CAAE,CAAC,cAGxCN,IAAA,WAAQM,EAAE,CAAC,QAAQ,CAAAC,QAAA,cACfP,IAAA,CAACH,IAAI,EAACgB,EAAE,CAAC,GAAG,CAAAN,QAAA,cACVP,IAAA,WAAQM,EAAE,CAAC,QAAQ,CAAAC,QAAA,CAAC,IAAE,CAAQ,CAAC,CAC3B,CAAC,CACD,CAAC,cAEXP,IAAA,SAAAO,QAAA,cACEL,KAAA,QAAKE,SAAS,CAAC,WAAW,CAAAG,QAAA,eAExBL,KAAA,QAAKE,SAAS,CAAC,QAAQ,CAAAG,QAAA,eAErBP,IAAA,YAASM,EAAE,CAAC,OAAO,CAAAC,QAAA,cACjBP,IAAA,OAAAO,QAAA,CAAI,YAAU,CAAI,CAAC,CACZ,CAAC,cAEVL,KAAA,YAASE,SAAS,CAAC,SAAS,CAACE,EAAE,CAAC,OAAO,CAAAC,QAAA,eACrCL,KAAA,OAAAK,QAAA,EAAI,gBAAc,cAAAP,IAAA,MAAAO,QAAA,CAAG,6BAA2B,CAAG,CAAC,IAAC,EAAI,CAAC,cAC1DL,KAAA,OAAAK,QAAA,eACEP,IAAA,QAAKc,IAAI,CAAC,SAAS,CAACC,KAAK,CAAC,MAAM,CAACC,MAAM,CAAC,MAAM,CAACC,OAAO,CAAC,KAAK,CAACX,EAAE,CAAC,QAAQ,CAACY,KAAK,CAAC,4BAA4B,CAACC,UAAU,CAAC,8BAA8B,CAACC,OAAO,CAAC,mBAAmB,CAACC,QAAQ,CAAC,UAAU,CAAAd,QAAA,cACnML,KAAA,MAAAK,QAAA,EAAG,GAAC,cAAAP,IAAA,SAAMsB,CAAC,CAAC,2hBAA2hB,CAAE,CAAC,IAAC,EAAG,CAAC,CAC5iB,CAAC,qDAEN,cAAAtB,IAAA,QAAKc,IAAI,CAAC,SAAS,CAACC,KAAK,CAAC,MAAM,CAACC,MAAM,CAAC,MAAM,CAACC,OAAO,CAAC,KAAK,CAACX,EAAE,CAAC,QAAQ,CAACY,KAAK,CAAC,4BAA4B,CAACC,UAAU,CAAC,8BAA8B,CAACC,OAAO,CAAC,mBAAmB,CAACC,QAAQ,CAAC,UAAU,CAAAd,QAAA,cACnML,KAAA,MAAAK,QAAA,EAAG,GAAC,cAAAP,IAAA,SAAMsB,CAAC,CAAC,2hBAA2hB,CAAE,CAAC,IAAC,EAAG,CAAC,CAC5iB,CAAC,EACJ,CAAC,whBAKL,cAAAtB,IAAA,QAAK,CAAC,cACNA,IAAA,QAAK,CAAC,mdAKN,cAAAA,IAAA,QAAK,CAAC,cACNA,IAAA,QAAK,CAAC,wUAIR,EAAS,CAAC,EACP,CAAC,cAENE,KAAA,QAAKE,SAAS,CAAC,QAAQ,CAAAG,QAAA,eACrBL,KAAA,YAASE,SAAS,CAAC,SAAS,CAACE,EAAE,CAAC,YAAY,CAAAC,QAAA,eAC1CP,IAAA,OAAAO,QAAA,CAAI,eAAa,CAAI,CAAC,2qBAMxB,EAAS,CAAC,cACVL,KAAA,YAASE,SAAS,CAAC,SAAS,CAACE,EAAE,CAAC,SAAS,CAAAC,QAAA,eACvCP,IAAA,OAAAO,QAAA,CAAI,YAAU,CAAI,CAAC,QAEnB,cAAAP,IAAA,OAAAO,QAAA,CAAI,GAAC,CAAI,CAAC,OAEV,cAAAP,IAAA,OAAAO,QAAA,CAAI,GAAC,CAAI,CAAC,EACH,CAAC,EACP,CAAC,EACH,CAAC,CACF,CAAC,cAEPL,KAAA,WAAAK,QAAA,eAEEP,IAAA,QAAKI,SAAS,CAAC,SAAS,CAAAG,QAAA,cACtBP,IAAA,MAAAO,QAAA,CAAG,4BAAuB,CAAG,CAAC,CACzB,CAAC,cAENP,IAAA,QAAKI,SAAS,CAAC,WAAW,CAAAG,QAAA,cACxBL,KAAA,MAAAK,QAAA,EAAG,WAED,cAAAL,KAAA,QAAKe,OAAO,CAAC,OAAO,CAACX,EAAE,CAAC,SAAS,CAACY,KAAK,CAAC,4BAA4B,CAACK,UAAU,CAAC,8BAA8B,CAACR,KAAK,CAAC,MAAM,CAACC,MAAM,CAAC,MAAM,CAACI,OAAO,CAAC,WAAW,CAACI,gBAAgB,CAAC,eAAe,CAACC,QAAQ,CAAC,UAAU,CAACX,IAAI,CAAC,SAAS,CAAAP,QAAA,eAACP,IAAA,MAAGM,EAAE,CAAC,mBAAmB,CAACoB,WAAW,CAAC,KAAK,CAAE,CAAC,cAAA1B,IAAA,MAAGM,EAAE,CAAC,uBAAuB,CAACqB,aAAa,CAAC,OAAO,CAACC,cAAc,CAAC,OAAO,CAAE,CAAC,cAAA1B,KAAA,MAAGI,EAAE,CAAC,qBAAqB,CAAAC,QAAA,EAAC,GAAC,cAAAP,IAAA,SAAMc,IAAI,CAAC,SAAS,CAACQ,CAAC,CAAC,iTAAiT,CAAE,CAAC,IAAC,EAAG,CAAC,EAAK,CAAC,EAC/sB,CAAC,CACD,CAAC,EACF,CAAC,EACN,CAAC,CAEV,CAEA,cAAe,CAAAnB,EAAE","ignoreList":[]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}
