I dont see it as a drawback though, as I still had my takeaways from it and was focused on other\n          things at the time and just kind of moved forward in my life but it was still a fun little project and the only one where I tried to make a two-foot tall wooden speaker box\n          in my one bedroom apartment with a jigsaw....I'm sure my neighbors loved me for that one. 😅\n        </section>\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"grid-2\">\n        {/* Section | Background */}\n        <section className=\"section\" id=\"background\">\n          <h3> Background: </h3>\n          Background time...So around this time I was really into music. I recently had completed a college elective on audio production, I was learning to \n          appreciate music and already had a strong interest in music composition and would occasionally write a little song on my keyboard or guitar.\n          I think the inspiration from it came from when I was doodling with my guitar that I kind of ran into a mental block because I was thinking about\n          all the small steps of like trying to setup my mics and audio stuff that I would just get lazy and not want to record my song because of it.\n          And that's pretty much it....just being lazy, think of a robot and boom; million dollar idea. 😂\n        </section>\n        {/* Section | Concept */}\n        <section className=\"section\" id=\"concept\">\n          <h3> Concept: </h3>\n          Core: \n          <li> </li>\n          Sub: \n          <li> </li>\n        </section>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </main>\n  {/* Footer */}\n  <footer> \n    {/* Copyright */}\n    <div className=\"graphic\">\n          <p> © 2025 Grayden Scovil </p> \n          </div>\n          {/* Love Note */}\n          <div className=\"love-note\">\n            <p> \n              Made with \n              <svg version=\"{1.0}\" id=\"Layer_1\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" xmlnsxlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" width=\"23px\" height=\"13px\" viewBox=\"0 0 64 64\" enablebackground=\"new 0 0 64 64\" xmlspace=\"preserve\" fill=\"#ffffff\"><g id=\"SVGRepo_bgCarrier\" strokewidth=\"{0}\" /><g id=\"SVGRepo_tracerCarrier\" strokelinecap=\"round\" strokelinejoin=\"round\" /><g id=\"SVGRepo_iconCarrier\"> <path fill=\"#ffffff\" d=\"M47.977,5.99c-4.416,0-8.414,1.792-11.308,4.686l-4.685,4.654l-4.686-4.654 C24.406,7.782,20.408,5.99,15.992,5.99C7.161,5.99,0,13.15,0,21.982c0,4.416,2.85,8.539,5.747,11.432l23.41,23.414 c1.562,1.562,4.092,1.562,5.653,0l23.349-23.352c2.896-2.893,5.81-7.078,5.81-11.494C63.969,13.15,56.808,5.99,47.977,5.99z\" /> </g></svg>\n            </p>\n          </div>   \n  </footer>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default Muse;\n"],"mappings":"AAAA,MAAO,CAAAA,KAAK,KAAM,OAAO,CACzB,OAASC,IAAI,KAAQ,kBAAkB,CAEvC,MAAO,4BAA4B,CACnC,MAAO,CAAAC,OAAO,KAAM,4BAA4B,CAAC,OAAAC,GAAA,IAAAC,IAAA,CAAAC,IAAA,IAAAC,KAAA,yBAEjD,QAAS,CAAAC,IAAIA,CAAA,CAAG,CACd,mBACFD,KAAA,QAAKE,SAAS,CAAEN,OAAO,CAACO,KAAM,CAACC,EAAE,CAAC,OAAO,CAAAC,QAAA,eAGvCP,IAAA,SAAMQ,OAAO,CAAC,OAAO,CAACC,IAAI,CAAC,UAAU,CAACC,OAAO,CAAC,uCAAuC,CAAE,CAAC,cAExFV,IAAA,UAAAO,QAAA,CAAO,QAAM,CAAO,CAAC,cAKrBP,IAAA,QAAKI,SAAS,CAAC,SAAS,CAACE,EAAE,CAAC,SAAS,CAAE,CAAC,cAGxCN,IAAA,WAAQM,EAAE,CAAC,QAAQ,CAAAC,QAAA,cACfP,IAAA,CAACH,IAAI,EAACc,EAAE,CAAC,GAAG,CAAAJ,QAAA,cACVP,IAAA,WAAQM,EAAE,CAAC,QAAQ,CAAAC,QAAA,CAAC,IAAE,CAAQ,CAAC,CAC3B,CAAC,CACH,CAAC,cAETP,IAAA,SAAAO,QAAA,cACEL,KAAA,QAAKE,SAAS,CAAC,WAAW,CAAAG,QAAA,eAExBL,KAAA,QAAKE,SAAS,CAAC,QAAQ,CAAAG,QAAA,eAErBP,IAAA,YAASM,EAAE,CAAC,OAAO,CAAAC,QAAA,cACjBP,IAAA,OAAAO,QAAA,CAAI,QAAM,CAAI,CAAC,CACR,CAAC,cAEVL,KAAA,YAASE,SAAS,CAAC,SAAS,CAACE,EAAE,CAAC,OAAO,CAAAC,QAAA,eACrCL,KAAA,OAAAK,QAAA,EAAI,gBAAc,cAAAP,IAAA,MAAAO,QAAA,CAAG,6BAA2B,CAAG,CAAC,IAAC,EAAI,CAAC,cAC1DL,KAAA,OAAAK,QAAA,eACEP,IAAA,QAAKY,IAAI,CAAC,SAAS,CAACC,KAAK,CAAC,MAAM,CAACC,MAAM,CAAC,MAAM,CAACC,OAAO,CAAC,KAAK,CAACT,EAAE,CAAC,QAAQ,CAACU,KAAK,CAAC,4BAA4B,CAACC,UAAU,CAAC,8BAA8B,CAACC,OAAO,CAAC,mBAAmB,CAACC,QAAQ,CAAC,UAAU,CAAAZ,QAAA,cACnML,KAAA,MAAAK,QAAA,EAAG,GAAC,cAAAP,IAAA,SAAMoB,CAAC,CAAC,2hBAA2hB,CAAE,CAAC,IAAC,EAAG,CAAC,CAC5iB,CAAC,qDAEN,cAAApB,IAAA,QAAKY,IAAI,CAAC,SAAS,CAACC,KAAK,CAAC,MAAM,CAACC,MAAM,CAAC,MAAM,CAACC,OAAO,CAAC,KAAK,CAACT,EAAE,CAAC,QAAQ,CAACU,KAAK,CAAC,4BAA4B,CAACC,UAAU,CAAC,8BAA8B,CAACC,OAAO,CAAC,mBAAmB,CAACC,QAAQ,CAAC,UAAU,CAAAZ,QAAA,cACjML,KAAA,MAAAK,QAAA,EAAG,GAAC,cAAAP,IAAA,SAAMoB,CAAC,CAAC,2hBAA2hB,CAAE,CAAC,IAAC,EAAG,CAAC,CAC9iB,CAAC,EACJ,CAAC,+sBAML,cAAApB,IAAA,QAAK,CAAC,cACNA,IAAA,QAAK,CAAC,q6BAOR,EAAS,CAAC,EACP,CAAC,cACNE,KAAA,QAAKE,SAAS,CAAC,QAAQ,CAAAG,QAAA,eAErBL,KAAA,YAASE,SAAS,CAAC,SAAS,CAACE,EAAE,CAAC,YAAY,CAAAC,QAAA,eAC1CP,IAAA,OAAAO,QAAA,CAAI,eAAa,CAAI,CAAC,0qBAMxB,EAAS,CAAC,cAEVL,KAAA,YAASE,SAAS,CAAC,SAAS,CAACE,EAAE,CAAC,SAAS,CAAAC,QAAA,eACvCP,IAAA,OAAAO,QAAA,CAAI,YAAU,CAAI,CAAC,QAEnB,cAAAP,IAAA,OAAAO,QAAA,CAAI,GAAC,CAAI,CAAC,OAEV,cAAAP,IAAA,OAAAO,QAAA,CAAI,GAAC,CAAI,CAAC,EACH,CAAC,EACP,CAAC,EACH,CAAC,CACF,CAAC,cAEPL,KAAA,WAAAK,QAAA,eAEEP,IAAA,QAAKI,SAAS,CAAC,SAAS,CAAAG,QAAA,cAClBP,IAAA,MAAAO,QAAA,CAAG,4BAAuB,CAAG,CAAC,CACzB,CAAC,cAENP,IAAA,QAAKI,SAAS,CAAC,WAAW,CAAAG,QAAA,cACxBL,KAAA,MAAAK,QAAA,EAAG,WAED,cAAAL,KAAA,QAAKa,OAAO,CAAC,OAAO,CAACT,EAAE,CAAC,SAAS,CAACU,KAAK,CAAC,4BAA4B,CAACK,UAAU,CAAC,8BAA8B,CAACR,KAAK,CAAC,MAAM,CAACC,MAAM,CAAC,MAAM,CAACI,OAAO,CAAC,WAAW,CAACI,gBAAgB,CAAC,eAAe,CAACC,QAAQ,CAAC,UAAU,CAACX,IAAI,CAAC,SAAS,CAAAL,QAAA,eAACP,IAAA,MAAGM,EAAE,CAAC,mBAAmB,CAACkB,WAAW,CAAC,KAAK,CAAE,CAAC,cAAAxB,IAAA,MAAGM,EAAE,CAAC,uBAAuB,CAACmB,aAAa,CAAC,OAAO,CAACC,cAAc,CAAC,OAAO,CAAE,CAAC,cAAAxB,KAAA,MAAGI,EAAE,CAAC,qBAAqB,CAAAC,QAAA,EAAC,GAAC,cAAAP,IAAA,SAAMY,IAAI,CAAC,SAAS,CAACQ,CAAC,CAAC,iTAAiT,CAAE,CAAC,IAAC,EAAG,CAAC,EAAK,CAAC,EAC/sB,CAAC,CACD,CAAC,EACN,CAAC,EACF,CAAC,CAEV,CAEA,cAAe,CAAAjB,IAAI","ignoreList":[]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}
